What is this all about?
=======================

This project is about making an ugly web interface of JIRA3.x (a popular Bug Tracking System) look somewhat more pleasing. I’m doing it in my spare time, whenever I feel like digging through horrible HTML code and then trying to apply some CSS to it in order to make it look better. That said, it does not happen very often, so please don’t expect constant updates here. Yet still, any contribution is welcome.

Installation
============

Click on the grey ZIP button higher up on the page, save the file to your hard drive and then extract its contents somewhere you won't forget. Then in Opera, go to any BTS page, right click on an empty area of the page and choose Edit Site Preferences. In the dialog, go to the Display tab and click the "Choose" button at the bottom. Navigate to the "usercss-jira3.css" file in the directory you extracted the downloaded archive to and click OK. Refresh the BTS page and you're done.

Something to keep in mind:

* I’m only testing the changes in Opera 11 and higher, so I can’t promise that it will not break in any other browsers, does not matter how awesome they are. Feel free to add support for those on your own :]
* I’ll try to comment my code as much as possible, but sometimes I can be just too tired and lazy to do so. Please excuse me for that.
